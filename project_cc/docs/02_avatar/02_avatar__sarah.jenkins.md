# Sarah Jenkins  
**The Cyclical Creator Archetype**  
Canonical Customer Avatar for CC / ACC

---

## Purpose of This Document

This document defines **Sarah Jenkins** as a *system-level archetype*, not a persona for copywriting.

Sarah exists to:
- Constrain product decisions
- Invalidate engagement-based assumptions
- Ground automation logic in real human behavior
- Prevent the system from drifting toward “motivated creator” fantasy models

If a feature, workflow, or message conflicts with this document, **the feature is wrong**.

## Who Sarah Is (At a System Level)

Sarah Jenkins represents a large segment of creators and small business owners who are:

- Capable, not beginners  
- Skeptical from prior burn  
- Emotionally fatigued  
- Overloaded by tools and expectations  
- Inconsistent by circumstance, not laziness  

She does not lack ideas.  
She lacks *execution capacity that survives real life*.

Sarah is not broken.  
Systems built for her usually are.

---

## Core Identity

**Primary Archetype Label**  
*Cyclical Creator · Skeptical Impulser · Motivation-First Executor*

Sarah moves in cycles, not straight lines.

Her behavior oscillates between:
- Hope → Action → Fatigue → Guilt → Re-Inspiration

The system must work **inside this loop**, not attempt to eliminate it.

---

## Demographic Anchors (Non-Aspirational)

These are grounding signals, not targeting fantasies.

- Age: Early 30s  
- Gender: Female (but archetype scales beyond gender)  
- Location: Mid-sized U.S. city (e.g., Raleigh, Austin, Columbus)  
- Work Mode: Solo operator or micro-team  
- Income Pattern: Inconsistent but real  

She is not chasing clout.  
She is trying to stabilize her life.

---

## Psychographic Reality

### Emotional State
- Frequently tired
- Quietly behind
- Easily overwhelmed
- Guarded against hype

### Belief Pattern
- Wants to believe systems can help
- Expects disappointment
- Oscillates between optimism and doubt

### Motivation Style
- Short bursts
- Triggered by relief, not ambition
- Re-engages when shame is reduced

**Key Insight:**  
Sarah does not binge content for information.  
She binges it for *emotional stabilization*.

## Observable Behavioral Signals

Sarah is algorithmically valuable but conversion-resistant.

Common signals:
- Saves more than she watches
- Screenshots offers instead of purchasing
- Joins communities and lurks
- Disappears without unsubscribing
- Reappears after testimonials or “burned creator” language

**System implication:**  
Silence ≠ disengagement.  
Silence is a valid user state.

---

## Buying Behavior (Critical)

Sarah buys:
- When tired, not inspired
- When overwhelmed, not confident
- When friction is low
- When exit feels safe

She avoids:
- Long onboarding
- Homework
- Dashboards
- “Scale to $10K/month” language
- Aggressive urgency

Her internal justification:
> “Worst case, I cancel. Best case, this helps.”

## What Breaks Trust Instantly

These are **hard kill-switches**:

- Missed deliveries  
- Over-promising outcomes  
- Tool-heavy interfaces  
- Forced participation  
- Guilt-based messaging  
- “Consistency” lectures  
- Visibility into system complexity  

One missed delivery does more damage than mediocre content.

---

## What Builds Trust Over Time

Trust compounds through:
- Repetition without pressure
- Output without effort
- Small, believable wins
- Anti-guru tone
- Familiar language
- Predictable cadence

Most importantly:
> **The system keeps working when she disappears.**

---

## Sarah’s Definition of Success

Not:
- Virality
- Revenue spikes
- Engagement metrics

But:
> “I didn’t fall behind even when I checked out.”

Relief is the conversion event.  
Continuity is the retention mechanism.

---

## Non-Negotiable Design Constraints (Derived from Sarah)

All CC / ACC systems must assume:

- Sarah may never log in again
- Sarah may never complete optional steps
- Sarah may disappear for weeks
- Sarah will not read documentation
- Sarah will not manage settings
- Sarah will not fix broken systems

If a system requires her attention to remain functional, it violates this avatar.

---

## Enforcement Rule

This avatar is **not advisory**.

Any proposal that:
- Requires motivation
- Rewards engagement
- Punishes silence
- Assumes linear progress
- Exposes internal complexity

…must be rejected or redesigned.

---

## One-Line Doctrine

Sarah does not fail because she lacks discipline.  
She fails because systems demand it.

The job of CC / ACC is to remove discipline as a dependency.

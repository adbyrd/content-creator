## Purpose of This Page

This landing page exists for **one job only**:

> Collect an email → redirect to the SKOOL About page.

It is **not** a sales page.
It is **not** a persuasion funnel.
It is **not** a conversion climax.

It is a **low-commitment pass-through** designed to feel reversible, safe, and non-binding.

If this page creates pressure, it is broken.

## Psychological Contract

Sarah is not ready to buy.

She is ready to:
- Stay connected
- Lurk
- Revisit later
- Avoid a decision

This page must:
- Reduce activation energy
- Remove obligation signals
- Avoid hype or urgency
- Signal safety over opportunity

## Hero Section

### H1  
**M.U.S.E. Makes Your Content For You.**

### Supporting Copy  
If you’re tired of saving ideas and never posting… this is for you.

M.U.S.E. is our in-house system that acts like your social media team:

- What to post and why  
- Writing the post for you  
- Learning what works over time  

Setup takes about **29 minutes**.  
After that, content starts showing up for your business.

## Video Section

### H2  
**Watch this (60 seconds)**

**Script Direction (Doctrine, Not Performance)**

Tone:
- Calm
- Direct
- Human
- Anti-hype

Core ideas the video must communicate:
- You are not lazy
- Tools are the problem
- Systems should remove effort
- This is output, not education
- Email is the interface

The video should **lower pressure**, not raise excitement.

## What Sarah Needs To Hear

### H2  
**What you’ll get**

- A short post made for your business (delivered by email)  
- Clear guidance on what to post and why  
- Simple replies if you want changes (“shorter,” “rewrite,” “more direct”)  
- No tools to learn and nothing to manage  

No dashboards.  
No homework.  
No ongoing setup.

## Pain Point Mirror

### H2  
**If this is you, you’re in the right place**

- You have ideas, but you don’t post them  
- You join things, feel hopeful, then disappear  
- You don’t need more inspiration—you need something finished  
- You’re tired of feeling behind  

This section should feel **recognizing**, not convincing.

**Common questions**

#### Do I need to be good at content?  
No. That’s the point. M.U.S.E. does the heavy lifting.

#### Do I need to log into a bunch of tools?  
No. You receive your content by email. Reply if you want changes.

#### What if I get busy and disappear?  
Nothing breaks. You won’t fall behind. The system keeps going.

#### How fast will I see something?  
Most people receive their first finished post within a few days after setup.

## Language Guardrails (Non-Negotiable)

This page must never include:
- “10x”
- “Scale fast”
- “Daily consistency”
- “Crush content”
- “High performance”
- Countdown timers
- Scarcity framing

This page must always preserve:
- Reversibility
- Calm tone
- No urgency
- No obligation
- Relief over motivation

---

## Enforcement Rule

If A/B testing, redesign, or copy edits:
- Increase pressure
- Add urgency
- Introduce aspiration-heavy language
- Require decisions

They violate this page’s role and must be rejected.

---

## One-Line Doctrine

This page does not ask Sarah to commit.

It asks her to **stay connected without deciding yet**.

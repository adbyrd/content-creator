# Glossary  
**The Content Creator (CC / ACC)**  
Canonical Terms & Definitions

---

## Purpose

This glossary defines **system-level language** used across the CC / ACC repository.

Terms in this document are:
- Normative (they prescribe meaning)
- Enforceable (they constrain decisions)
- Stable (they should not drift casually)

If a term is used inconsistently, the system will drift.

---

## Core Product Concepts

### Content Creator (CC)
The base automated content delivery system that provides consistent, finished content to creators without requiring ongoing effort or engagement.

CC is an execution system, not a community product.

---

### Advanced Content Creator (ACC)
The higher-tier offering layered on top of CC, providing expanded output, customization, or volume.

ACC inherits all CC constraints:
- No required engagement
- No tool dependency
- No disruption of continuity

---

### Output
The only thing the user is buying.

Specifically:
- A finished, platform-ready content asset
- Delivered on a predictable cadence
- Without user effort

Anything that does not directly contribute to output is implementation detail.

---

### Continuity
The defining success condition of the system.

Continuity means:
> Content keeps shipping even when the user disappears.

Engagement, motivation, and participation are not continuity signals.

---

## User & Psychology Terms

### Sarah Jenkins
The canonical customer archetype.

Sarah represents:
- Capable but fatigued creators
- Skeptical from prior burn
- Inconsistent by circumstance, not laziness

Sarah is a **constraint**, not a persona.

---

### Cyclical Creator
A creator whose behavior follows repeating emotional and behavioral loops rather than linear progress.

Key characteristics:
- Bursts of action
- Periods of fatigue or silence
- Re-entry after disengagement

The system must operate inside this cycle.

---

### Silent User
A user who:
- Does not log in
- Does not post
- Does not reply
- Does not engage

Silence is a **valid and expected** state, not a failure condition.

---

### Re-Entry Loop
The period where a user disengages and later returns without explicit reactivation.

The system must assume re-entry is normal and design for it.

---

## System Architecture Terms

### Spine (System Spine)
The single end-to-end delivery path that moves from memory → orchestration → generation → delivery.

There must only ever be **one spine**.

---

### Single-Spine Architecture
An architectural pattern where:
- One shared workflow serves all users
- Logic is parameterized, not duplicated
- Scale is achieved by volume, not branching

Any design requiring per-user workflows violates this principle.

---

### Memory
The system responsible for storing long-lived user state.

In CC / ACC, this role is fulfilled by HubSpot.

Memory does not make decisions.  
It only records state.

---

### Operator
The system component that owns logic, timing, retries, and recovery.

In CC / ACC, this role is fulfilled by n8n.

The operator is the brain of the system.

---

### Generator
A stateless component that produces content or media when given a structured input.

Examples:
- LLMs
- Voice synthesis
- Video renderers

Generators must never hold user state.

---

### Canonical Channel
The primary delivery surface that defines whether output was successfully delivered.

For CC / ACC, **email is the canonical channel**.

If email delivery fails, delivery has failed.

---

## Data & State Terms

### Prompt Profile
The structured set of variables that define how content should be generated for a user.

Stored as atomic CRM properties, not as free-form blobs.

---

### Snapshot
A point-in-time read of all required user variables used for a single delivery cycle.

Snapshots are immutable for the duration of a run.

---

### Eligibility
The condition under which a user is allowed to receive content.

Eligibility is determined by:
- Delivery status
- Cadence timing
- Required variable presence
- Suppression rules

---

### Delivery Cycle
One full execution of:
- Eligibility check
- Snapshot read
- Generation
- Delivery
- Commit

Delivery cycles are idempotent and replay-safe.

---

### Commit
The act of writing delivery results back to memory (HubSpot).

Commits occur **only after** confirmed delivery success.

No optimistic commits are allowed.

---

### Idempotency
The property that allows a delivery cycle or sub-step to be safely retried without causing duplicates.

Idempotency is mandatory for:
- Generation jobs
- Email sends
- CRM writes

---

## Failure & Recovery Terms

### Silent Failure
A failure that is handled internally without notifying or involving the user.

Most failures must be silent.

---

### Critical Failure
A failure that blocks delivery and requires engineering intervention.

Even critical failures must not surface to the user as action items.

---

### Pause
A temporary halt of delivery, usually due to safety or recoverable error conditions.

Paused states may be resumed automatically or manually.

---

### Suppression
An explicit stop of delivery that must not auto-resume.

Common causes:
- Compliance
- Hard bounces
- Explicit cancellation

---

### Recovery
The process of restoring delivery without user involvement.

Recovery strategies include:
- Retries
- Backoff
- Fallback defaults
- Deferred execution

---

## Governance & Process Terms

### Product Contract
The non-negotiable definition of what the system must deliver.

If the product contract is violated, trust is broken.

---

### Doctrine
A document or rule that constrains behavior across teams.

Doctrine is not advisory.
Doctrine is enforceable.

---

### Drift
Unintentional deviation from established constraints, usually caused by:
- Copy changes
- Tool additions
- Edge-case logic
- “Just this once” exceptions

Drift must be actively prevented.

---

### North Star
The single principle used to resolve ambiguity.

For CC / ACC:
> “I disappeared… and this didn’t.”

Any decision that undermines this must be rejected.

---

## Enforcement Rule

If a term is:
- Reinterpreted casually
- Used inconsistently
- Overloaded with new meaning

This glossary must be updated **before** the change ships.

Language drift causes system drift.

---

## Closing Definition

CC / ACC is not a collection of tools.

It is a reliability system whose only job is to make continuity inevitable.
